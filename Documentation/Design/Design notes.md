## Modifiers

Preferably we would have all modifiers combined as a unique symbol; the main glyph represents an access modifier.

```                 
                    Sym.    Name
public              ‚Äí       Figure dash
protected           ‚ó†       Upper half circle
internal            ‚ïå       Double dash
protected internal  ‚ïç       Heavy double dash
private             ‚ñ∞       Black parallelogram
```

A ring under the modifier indicates static access.


Considered alternatives included:
- Coloring (vary color to indicate access)
- Geometric shapes (circle, square, lozenge)

*Keywords*
dash, horizontal, bar, circle, square, box, black

A base symbol is declined using combining symbols and side-scripts.

TODO:
- Combined forms should not appear in the selector

## Windows Compatibility

- `static` modifier appears on the right (should be center)
- `struct`, `==`, `this` and `private` symbols are oversized
- `new` symbol is out of line
- `Action` and `Func` are undersized
- `Vector4` combining symbol renders to the right (should be above)
