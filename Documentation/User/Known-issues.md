## Deleting, moving and renaming files

Deleting, moving and renaming \*.howl sources should be done using the Unity Editor.

Howl relies on Unity Editor events to decide whether a file has moved, or was deleted; provided you are using the Unity Editor, C# counterparts will be moved/deleted/renamed accordingly.
