# Notes

## Whitespace discards

The easiest approach to discards is including whitespace inside the base definition:



## Better whitespace control

We don't want to add too many spaces.
Specifically, if a symbol is not followed by a letter or digit,
it is safe.
Unless the next symbol is itself soft.

## Whitespace on export

This applies to a number of mappings, notably when the source is an alphanumerical keyword (such as 'public') and the target is a symbol.
Where the source and target are both symbols, the problem does not exist.

So, let's consider an `Air(string, char[])` function which is used to add such whitespace.

In a first approximation:

```cs
ㄹ Air(ㄹ ㅂ, char[] S)
=> (from c in ㅂ select c.Consolidate(against: S)).Join();
```

Where `S` is a set of "soft" symbols, and Consolidate()

```cs
ㄹ Consolidate(this char c, char[] S)
=> new ㄹ(c) + S.Contains(c) ? " " : null;
```

Then we need a function to extract soft symbols (Map.cs)

```cs
public char[] operator ! (Map m)
=> (from x in m.rules where !x select x.a[0]).ToArray();
```

A definition of `!x` (for 'soft') is added to Rep.cs

Finally, integrate solution with `Map` and functional test.

## Asset move and delete operations

When a howl file is deleted, we of course want the matching C# file to also be deleted.
Let's create a functional test for this.
Now, let's implement this.

```cs
if(π.IsHowlSource()) AssetDatabase.DeleteAsset(π.OutPath());
```

These functions already exist, but we need to migrate them and improve them a little.

Good so far. Now, the move operation; first, the test; next, the implementation.

Getting the functional test to work was... a bit tricky, mostly
because of small differences between asset ops via Unity's AssetDB and file system ops.

There's a couple more cases to cover. What if...
- We moved a howl asset outside the howl source dir?
- We moved a howl asset from outside the howl source dir, to within?

First the inbound operation. In this case a new C# file needs to be generated, unless allowExport is enabled

Now the outbound operation. In this case a C# file needs to be
deleted, unless:
- allowExport is disabled
- or no such file existed in the first place.
