# Dotnet on Gibash

This by default may/may not be working. But first let's restart gitbash.
Ha! Now it does.
Well document this.
I can build okay but the top level structure looks different... or not?

So I setup everything as follows:

/usr/lib/howl/CLI.exe
/usr/bin/howl

The reply comes:

```
The application to execute does not exist: 'C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\CLI.dll'.
```

Adding to ~/.bashrc is less mystifying.
