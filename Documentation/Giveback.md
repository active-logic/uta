# Howl is (mostly) free software, let's keep it this way.

Howl, the symbolic notation for OOP programming, is currently free on the Unity Asset store, free for solo users and (single seat only) free for some enterprise users.

There are a few ways you can help, which are listed on this page, but first let's answer a couple of questions about Howl.

**How long is the software going to be supported?**

The author have no plans to backtrack/revert to verbose (ascii) notations. In some degree this ensures continued development and (eventually) extending Howl to other languages.

Features "on the roadmap", that will be made regardless of how large/small the user community:

- Streamline `using` (‚äê) via hinted import.
- Package management so nimble it will make PyPI and NPM look like stately old spinsters.

**What kind of help is needed to make Howl even more awesome?**

Community funding / sponsorships are needed to develop community features, such as:

- Option to use custom/own notations
- Visual studio support; code navigation support
- Anything labeled CLI (command line interface)

Where community support is lacking (talking finance here), community features will be processed slowly, or may partake a "premium" version of the Howl software.

## How you can help

Since you are here, star and follow the library.

Also, if you are a Unity user, take the time to [rate and review the Unity integration](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/slug/177081).

You may also [hire the dev](http://www.linkedin.com/in/tds79) at commercial rates; expertise covers the following:

- API design
- Game AI/Game Logic (no ML please)
- Compatibility, build systems, documentation and other plumbing (Win/MacOS/Nix)
- Programming language design
- Visual design (usability/HCI)
- Mentoring/coaching

Have a nice time howling, stay on fire üî• and eat cake üç∞
