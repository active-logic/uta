# Howl

Howl is a symbolic notation engine for C# programming. Have a look:

```
„Öá IsEscapedDoubleQuoteInString(„Ñπ x, ·Üû i){
    ‚§¥ (suffix ‚â† "\"" ‚à® x[i] ‚â† '"') ‚Æê ‚úó;
    „Öá esc = ‚úó;
    ‚ü≤ (--i > 0){
        ‚§¥ (x[i] ‚â† '\\') ¬¶
        ‚§µ esc = !esc;
    }
    ‚Æê esc;
}
```

Here is the C# translation:

```cs
bool IsEscapedDoubleQuoteInString(string x, int i){
    if (suffix != "\"" || x[i] != '"') return false;
    bool esc = false;
    while (--i > 0){
        if (x[i] != '\\') break;
         else esc = !esc;
    }
    return esc;
}
```

- Howl is a superset of C#: configure which notations are applied, be it on first import, or later. 
- Bi-directional translation imports your legacy (C#) sources.
- Input Howl source comfortably (VS Code and Atom snippets). As you type C#, Howl source is generated; therefore, learning the notation is easy and fun.


In Atom, beautiful syntax highlighting is also available.

**Unity 3D**: The UPM package provides seamless build integration: 

Howl, build and publish either C#, Howl scripts, or both.

## Why Howl?

Notations are used in music, mathematics, dance and many other places. The case for any notation is that once you know it, information processing is faster.

Muting language level semantics increases focus. Also, modifiers and keywords take up space (up to 20% of your program source). Compressing this helps with writing delightfully concise, readable and expressive programs.

## Getting started

This UPM package requires Unity 3D (the game engine). After adding the package to your project hit `Window > Activ > Howl` and follow simple steps to configure your work environment.

If you are using Atom (recommended), find tips to resolve install woes and make yourself at ease on the [Howl plugin homepage](https://github.com/eelstork/language-howl/blob/master/README.md).

Once you are setup, typing C# in `*.howl` scripts generates Howl on the fly (via snippets). In the same way that C# builds automatically in Unity, your Howl scripts will be recompiled on save.

**TIP**: Import, export and symset config may also be applied on a per file/directory basis via the Unity project window.

## Good to know

**Use the Unity project window to move and delete Howl scripts**. This is similar to how Unity does not like you modifying files outside the editor.

Unity needs to see the C# output in order to build your project. We keep the C# output under `Assets/~build`. It is okay to move/rename this but if you do so, close Unity first and do it manually.

If you are using **assemblies**:

- Howl supports *\*.asmdef* on import. Your assembly definitions are placed in the `~build` directory.
- Edit assembly definitions as normal, except they now live inside the `~build` directory.
- Do not mix Howl and C# sources in the same assembly; this is not supported and you will get errors.
- Do not delete the `~build` directory (or lose your assembly definitions).
- Currently you may only have ONE `~build` directory.

Should you wish to create a new assembly for your Howl scripts:

1) Create the assembly normally. The same way that you create assemblies for C# sources.
2) Right click on the assembly and select `Use Howl`.

Howl generates *\*.asmdt* token files which are just house-keeping so we know where to find the C# assemblies.
